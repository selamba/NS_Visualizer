This program requires the "Ruby2D" gem to work.

The visualizer can be accessed via the "visualize" function of the "Visualizer" class.
It takes 5 parameters: number of input nodes, number of intermediate layers,
number of nodes per intermediate layer, and the number of output nodes.
The fifth parameter is "debug" which is used for development and defaults to "false".

You can control the visual appearance of the neural network by pressing relevant keys:
Numpad+ -> Increase node size  
Numpad- -> Decrease node size

Escape -> Close the program
